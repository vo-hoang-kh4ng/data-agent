"""Generic, unsupervised cluster characterization for the persona pipeline.

Computes, for each cluster, a `distinguishing_signal`: which behavioral domain

features with their human labels, and a short evidence sentence — all derived
from the active DatasetProfile's domains/labels, with NO churn/telco vocabulary.
